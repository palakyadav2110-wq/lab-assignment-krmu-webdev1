# PALAK Portfolio

This is my first personal portfolio website made using HTML. I made this to show my project skills, and to have a place where people can contact me.

I'm a first year B.tech student and I'm just starting to explore web development, CSS and HTML. I built this project while learning and experimenting with coding.

## Projects

- Personal Portfolio Website
